        "Good morning [Name],\nThank you for your willingness to volunteer for the Gateway Men’s Meeting this Friday evening. We truly appreciate your heart for service and helping carry the message.\n\nI just want to share a quick note about Gateway to Service. When we commit to attend, we’re committing not only to the group, but also to the patients who are counting on us to be there. Because of that, it’s important to only say yes if you’re confident you can attend as planned.\n\nIf you’re unsure about this Friday, it’s completely okay to let me know. We would rather give the opportunity to someone who knows they’re available than risk a last-minute cancellation.\n\nPlease reply to this text to let me know if you will or will not be attending. Either way, thank you again for your willingness to serve. God Bless 🙏🏾",
